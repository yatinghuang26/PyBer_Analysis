Project Overview

We were given the following tasks to perform an analysis of ride share data of urban, suburban, and rural cities.
  1. Determine the ride counts of urban, suburban, and rural cities.
  2. Calculate the average and total fares of each city type.
  3. Determine the average and total driver counts of each city type.
  4. Build multiple types of plots to determine the relationships between drivers, ridership, and fares.

Results

From the 'Total Fare by City Type' line plot and its respective data frame, we have concluded that ride count, driver count, and fare amount are the highest in urban cities. Looking at all weeks, fares of urban cities double that of suburban fares. Lastly, fares of rural cities are the lowest, not even close to the fares of suburban cities, which ranked second.
Urban cities do have more rides (1,625 rides) than suburban (625 rides) and rural (125 rides). This means the driver count is the highest in urban cities to service the rides. Also, this would explain the difference between total fares of city types.
There is a significant difference in average fare per driver. Urban cities have the most ride count but average fare per driver is the lowest, which means it is actually the least profitability city type.

Summary

  1. Allocate driver count according to the peaks, have more drivers available in areas where rider count is higher. 
  2. Suburban and rural rides can be considered as gateway rides to urban cities, so consider offering more discounts in those cities to increase ridership. When they get to the urban cities, they will need rides to travel there so we increase revenue and ride count there as well.
  3. Consider expanding more drivers to suburban and rural cites since the profitability is higher. These city types have less options for travel so creating more rides will boost revenue.
